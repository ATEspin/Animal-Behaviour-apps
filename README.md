Tools for analysis of rat behavioral experiments.

### Installing

Requires Python 3.  

Once Python 3 is installed, Iistall by installing package with `pip`. In a command line change directories to this folder, ie. one containing `setup.py` and run `pip install .`.  This will install Xmaze.py to the python scripts folder which can then be run.

### Dist


- `pip install virtualenv`
- `virtualenv venv`
- `source venv/scripts/activate`
- `pip install . pyinstaller`
